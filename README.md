# Google-Vision-AIY-on-Wheels
## Motivation
After playing with Google Vision AIY kit I decided to put it on wheels and turn a cheap remote-controlled Arduino toy car kit into autonomous mobile Edge AI device. The new robot uses face-recognition model pre-installed on Google Vision AIY kit to search and approach faces or their images. Full documentation and methodology are provided in this tutorial. 
This is the demo of the final product:
